<p>Zentri Device Management Service instantly allows ZentriOS powered devices to be provisioned with a unique secure identity and configuration.</p>\
<p>The service is built to deliver secure, encrypted, product-specific over the air (OTA) updates to products that are in-market.</p>\
<p>A product inventory view is built into the service displaying real-time product updates including geo-location and status of the product.</p>\

<div class="content">\
<h1>Zentri Cloud Service</h1>\
<p>Customers who go beyond secure updates and product inventory can monitor and control their product using the Cloud Connector and Zentri Cloud Service.</p>\
<p>The service additionally allows secure delivery of analytics captured from the product to the cloud.</p>\
<p>A typical customer for this service requires deployment of the service in days or weeks and relies on Zentriâ€™s cloud infrastructure for product monitoring, control and capturing product analytics.</p>\
<p>The RESTful and WebSocket APIs that are part of the service may be used to compose operational dashboards or plug-in to existing dashboards.</p>\
